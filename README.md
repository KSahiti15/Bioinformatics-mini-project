Project Overview
The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive sequence analysis of the human TNF gene using publicly available tools and databases. This includes translating the gene to its protein form, identifying key regions such as ORFs, regulatory elements, transcription factor binding sites, and more.

Tools and Methods
NCBI GenBank – Sequence retrieval
BioEdit – Translation, ORF identification, nucleotide composition
PROMO – Transcription factor binding site prediction
MEME Suite – Motif identification
GENSCAN – Gene structure prediction (exons and introns)

Steps Performed
Sequence Retrieval
Retrieved the TNF gene FASTA sequence from NCBI.
DNA to Protein Translation
Used BioEdit to translate DNA to the corresponding amino acid sequence.
Open Reading Frame (ORF) Identification
Located ORFs using BioEdit's ORF Finder.
Nucleotide Composition Analysis
Calculated A, T, G, C frequencies and GC content in the sequence.
Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction
Used PROMO tool with Homo sapiens settings to identify potential TF binding regions.
Functional Motif Discovery
Employed MEME Suite to discover conserved motifs within the gene.
Exon/Intron Structure Prediction
Used GENSCAN to differentiate coding and non-coding regions of the gene.

Key Results
ORFs: Multiple open reading frames were identified, indicating potential coding regions.
GC Content: Calculated to assess sequence stability and functional relevance.
Motifs & TF Sites: Revealed biologically significant motifs and transcription factor binding sites involved in immune response.
Gene Structure: Predicted locations of introns, exons, and UTRs provided insights into gene regulation.

Conclusion
This project highlights the utility of basic bioinformatics tools for gene analysis. Through a series of in silico analyses, the structural and regulatory features of the TNF gene were identified, contributing to a better understanding of its role in inflammation and immune function.
